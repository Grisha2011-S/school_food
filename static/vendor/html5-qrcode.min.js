// Local placeholder for html5-qrcode
// This file is a lightweight fallback that intentionally does not implement the full
// html5-qrcode library. It exists so the app can load a local script when the CDN
// is blocked or returns incorrect MIME headers. When loaded, it does NOT define
// `Html5Qrcode`, so the app's JS will fall back to the native BarcodeDetector-based
// implementation already present in the code.

// If you want the full feature set of html5-qrcode, replace this file with the
// real `html5-qrcode.min.js` from the project's dist (e.g. via raw.githubusercontent.com or unpkg).

// Empty file on purpose.
